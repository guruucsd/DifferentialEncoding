Main branch:
  origin/develop - working code
  origin/master  - not really used

==================
= IN PROGRESS
==================

Features:
  origin/1D                 fix up 1D scripts (for use in bptt?)
  origin/2layer             hidden units actually unnecessary; matches work in recfields
  origin/bptt               make actual horizontal network; also leads to cc work
  origin/gabors             develop gabor filter inputs
  origin/img2pol            move to a "polar image" (r/theta, not x/y) (more like cortex, according to Plaut & Behrmann 2011
  origin/recfields          scripts for 'theoretical' study

Tests:
  origin/contrast           reduce contrast of images on input, output the original image
  origin/deepnetworks       stack networks
  origin/stacked            same as deep neworks?
  origin/mnist              ???
  origin/moretrain          allow the autoencoder weights to change, when training the perceptron (deep architecture)
  origin/mtl                train on autoencoder and perceptron at the same time, in parallel (post-autoencoder training)

==================
= Completed
==================

Papers:
  origin/COSYNE_2013        figures for cosyne 2013 paper
  origin/Hsiao_etal_2012    figures for hsiao et al 2012 paper

Features:
  origin/centropy           implement softmax / cross-entropy error
  origin/prunetrain         get connection selection via pruning to work
  origin/uber               training autoencoder on one dataset, then extracting hu activities on another

Tests:
  origin/density            develop distribution that varies the distribution of nodes, not the sigma

Cleanup:
  origin/broken_scripts     a place where those scripts live for easy playing with; we delete them everywhere else
  origin/reorg              a place to move around files
  origin/fixlabels          ???
  origin/parallel           get scripts running through parallel toolbox
  origin/parallel-fix       remove branched pathways
